# MusicPlayer
This is a music player that reads a path to a folder, and makes a playlist of all compatible file types.
<br>The file path is currently hardcoded.

The program uses WPF to handle the app and C# is used to handle the logic.

Current features are a .mp3 and .wav file support, play,skip, back, and shuffle button, a progress bar, a volume slider, loop options, and the list of songs in current play order.
<br>Future featurs are a config file, more file support (.ogg), selecting folders from the app, saving playlists, and adding songs to a saved playlist.
